## Plot

Spock woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an eggs he left for school.
Normally Spock would have walked down Bleaker Street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Spock’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Spock had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Spock would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

At this point, Spock was contemplating what he always thought of during these types of situations: "Why is it that my red-shirt crew members always die, even though I'm in the same situations?". And at that moment, he was contacted by the Enterprise and was beamed back up to the ship. Spock, Kirk, and Bones then laughed and smiled around the Captains chair, and Bones said "I'm a doctor, not an engineer".
The end.
